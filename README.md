# MDCV_6900(WIP)
This a small project aims to do real time object detection at a small scale. A it uses a HaarCascade to find the a face in a picture or video feed.It then identifies it using a small CNN. New faces can be added through either the use of VideoCamera of the laptop or a video. I have not yet checked the full capabilities of the system.
